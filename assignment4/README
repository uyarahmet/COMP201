ASSIGNMENT 4

This assignment consisted of an executable that could only be executed in our university's linuxpool servers where some passwords were hidden. 
We were asked to infer the passwords by observing its assembly while debugging. 
If we enterred a wrong password, then BOOM! one point is deducted from the assignment.
